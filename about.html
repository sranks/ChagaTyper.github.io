          <div class="about">
            <strong style="color: black;">Our platform is designed to allow you to gain a deeper understanding of Chagas Disease and <i>Trypanosoma Cruzi</i> . 
                <br> We want to provide you with the tools you need to better understand the disease patterns. By using genomic data gathered we are able to create interactive visualizations. 
                <br> <br> Our mission is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly hub for tracking and comprehending the disease dynamics.
                <br> <br> Please take some time and explore our first mock-up and we would really appreciate it if you could provide your feedback at the survey link below. 
                <br> Please note as of right now the visualizations are not interactive and are used as a ways to see what the fully functioning website will look like.

            <h2><i>Trypanosoma Cruzi</i></h2>
            <p class="Tcruzi"> Chagas disease is a vector-borne, systemic, and parasitic illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is primarily endemic to the Americas, 
                particularly in regions of Central and South American and typically effects poor socioeconomic areas where poverty and inadequate housing condition facilitate its transmission. 
                Chagas Disease is a complex health issue that affects humans and presents challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and control. </p>
